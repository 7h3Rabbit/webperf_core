## Translations

### Want to add another language? 

The multiple language support is built on `gettext` in Python.

#### How to support new language
You could either follow the more technical suggestions below, or you perhaps would like an application such as [Poedit](https://poedit.net) (available on Macos, Linux and Windows).

To create a new language source file:  
```python3 <your path to pygettext.py > -d webperf-core -o locales/webperf-core.pot default.py checks.py```
(or copy an existing one)

Copy the file to your locale, for Swedish it would be:  
```locales/sv/LC_MESSAGES/webperf-core.pot```

Rename the file extension from `.pot` to `.po`

After you have translated everything you should check it in, GitHub will take your change and generate .mo files when needed.
You now have support for a new language, please send it to the official repository using a pull request :)

#### How to find pygettext.py

Locate your pygettext.py file:  
```locate pygettext.py```

It might be as follows:  
```/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/share/doc/python3.8/examples/Tools/i18n/pygettext.py```
