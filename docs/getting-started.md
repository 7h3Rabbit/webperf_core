# Getting started


## Get started with webperf_core
Here are some suggestions on how to get started with the tests on your own computer. Actually, it is even easier to run the tests on a cloud environment such as [PythonAnywhere - $ 5 / month](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/?affiliate_id=0007e5c6) - then the technical environment is ready to just upload the files.

You download the code itself from [GitHub - webperf_core](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core) and place it in a good location on your computer.
### Adjust the source code
There are two files that you need to adjust:
* *SAMPLE-config.py* needs to be renamed to *config.py*
The reason for this is because if you download a new version of the code, your settings or data should not be overwritten by accident.

## Where to run?
