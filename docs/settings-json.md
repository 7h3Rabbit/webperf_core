# Why settings.json and what does it do?

With your own `settings.json` file you are able to use the same settings
every time you run webperf core, unlike using `--settings` that only affect current run.

## Why copy and rename defaults/config.py?

You *ONLY* need to copy defaults/settings.json IF you want to permanently change any settings.
Most people can use the default settings and only use `--settings` for when temporarly changing settings.
You should not change settings directly in defaults/config.py,
the reason for this is because if you download a new version of the code, your settings or data should not be overwritten by accident.

Because of this you need to copy `defaults/settings.json` and name the new version `settings.json` and place it in root folder.
Best practise is to only keep settings you want to activaly change in your `settings.json` file,
this way you will use default settings for everything else and when/if they change it is changes for you as well.

If you for example want to permanently change to activate details your own `settings.json` should look like:

```json
{
    "general": {
        "review": {
            "details": false,
        }
    }
}
```

## What do every configuration do?



### general
This section indicate the settings affects many test.

#### general.dns.address `(Default = 8.8.8.8)`

Address to nameserver used for DNS lookups.
Good if you for example have your own nameserver internally.

#### general.request.timeout `(Default = 60)`

This variable is used as request timeout where a single request is only needed and not a full browser simulation.
Example in the following tests:

- 404 (Page Not Found, used against your website)
- Usersâ€™ integrity test against Webbkoll (used against service)
- Standard Files (used against your website)
- HTTP Test (used against your website)

#### general.review.details `(Default = false)`

Setting this variable to true will result showing a more detailed review when available.
It is for example used in software test to show exactly what CVE and software you got less points to.
This is good todo when it is time to actually fix some of the issues and not only track where you are.

#### general.review.improve-only `(Default = true)`

Setting this variable to false will result in showing all reviews (not only review that points to possible improvements).
This is good if you want to look back on much you have improved over time.

#### general.useragent `(Default = latest Firefox on Ubuntu)`

This variable is used as user agent where a single request is only needed and not a full browser simulation.
Example in the following tests:

- 404 (Page Not Found, used against your website)
- Standard Files (used against your website)
- HTTP Test (used against your website)

#### general.cache.use `(Default = false)`
Changing this to `true` will make webperf-core use local cache where available.
This is perfect if you run more test as many tests can reuse data from previous test
resulting in less requests and strain on the url you are testing.

See `general.cache.max-age` setting to determine how long.

#### general.cache.max-age `(Default = 60 minutes)`
This tells webperf-core how long to use cached resources in minutes.
This take no effect unless `general.cache.use` is set to `true`.




### github

#### github.api.key `(Default = "")`
