# webperf_core
Minimalistic client mainly running on PythonAnywhere.com

## Dependencies
Not found in the standard lib:

* Flask
* flask_sqlalchemy
* sqlalchemy
* requests
* BeautifulSoup 4

Also need some MySQL stuff, but which libs differ on Macos and Linux. On PythonAnywhere.com it worked without any effort.
